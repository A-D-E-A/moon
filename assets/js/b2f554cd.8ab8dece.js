We greatly appreciate the\\nsupport, and to everyone that is using moon and providing feedback, we thank you from the bottom of\\nour hearts!\\n\\nWe have a very long roadmap ahead of us, but are very excited to bring all of these features to you,\\nand to improve the overall developer experience for your monorepos! Here\'s to 10,000 stars!\\n\\n## First-class Docker support\\n\\n[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a very popular tool that is typically a part of a developers\\nworkflow, but is also a very tedious one, as `Dockerfile`s have to be manually curated for every\\nproject. We aim to mitigate this problem by supporting Docker as a first-class feature, and by\\nintroducing 2 new commands, [`moon docker scaffold`](../docs/commands/docker/scaffold) and\\n[`moon docker prune`](../docs/commands/docker/prune).\\n\\nThese commands will automate a `Dockerfile` as much as possible to effectively take advantage of\\nDocker\'s layer caching, multi-staged builds, to reduce the amount of manual `COPY` commands, to\\nreduce the overall size of the container or image, and much more. To demonstrate this, compare the\\nbefore and after `Dockerfile`s below!\\n\\n<Tabs\\n  groupId=\\"dockerfile\\"\\n  defaultValue=\\"before\\"\\n  values={[\\n    { label: \'Before\', value: \'before\' },\\n    { label: \'After\', value: \'after\' },\\n  ]}\\n>\\n<TabItem value=\\"before\\">\\n\\n```docker\\nFROM node:latest\\n\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Install moon binary\\nRUN npm install -g @moonrepo/cli\\n\\n# Copy moon files\\nCOPY ./.moon ./.moon\\n\\n# Copy all package.json\'s and lockfiles\\nCOPY ./packages/cli/package.json ./packages/cli/package.json\\nCOPY ./packages/core-linux-arm64-gnu/package.json ./packages/core-linux-arm64-gnu/package.json\\nCOPY ./packages/core-linux-arm64-musl/package.json ./packages/core-linux-arm64-musl/package.json\\nCOPY ./packages/core-linux-x64-gnu/package.json ./packages/core-linux-x64-gnu/package.json\\nCOPY ./packages/core-linux-x64-musl/package.json ./packages/core-linux-x64-musl/package.json\\nCOPY ./packages/core-macos-arm64/package.json ./packages/core-macos-arm64/package.json\\nCOPY ./packages/core-macos-x64/package.json ./packages/core-macos-x64/package.json\\nCOPY ./packages/core-windows-x64-msvc/package.json ./packages/core-windows-x64-msvc/package.json\\nCOPY ./packages/runtime/package.json ./packages/runtime/package.json\\nCOPY ./packages/types/package.json ./packages/types/package.json\\nCOPY ./package.json ./package.json\\nCOPY ./yarn.lock ./yarn.lock\\nCOPY ./.yarn ./.yarn\\nCOPY ./.yarnrc.yml ./yarnrc.yml\\n\\n# Install toolchain and dependencies\\nRUN moon setup\\n\\n# Copy project and required files\\nCOPY ./packages/types ./packages/types\\nCOPY ./packages/runtime ./packages/runtime\\n# COPY . .\\n\\n# Build the target\\nRUN moon run runtime:build\\n```\\n\\n</TabItem>\\n<TabItem value=\\"after\\">\\n\\n```docker\\n#### BASE\\nFROM node:latest AS base\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Install moon binary\\nRUN npm install -g @moonrepo/cli\\n\\n#### WORKSPACE\\nFROM base AS workspace\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Copy entire repository and scaffold\\nCOPY . .\\nRUN moon docker scaffold runtime\\n\\n#### BUILD\\nFROM base AS build\\nWORKDIR /app\\n\\n# Copy workspace skeleton\\nCOPY --from=workspace /app/.moon/docker/workspace .\\n\\n# Install toolchain and dependencies\\nRUN moon setup\\n\\n# Copy source files\\nCOPY --from=workspace /app/.moon/docker/sources .\\n\\n# Build the target\\nRUN moon run runtime:build\\n\\n# Prune workspace\\nRUN moon docker prune\\n```\\n\\n</TabItem>\\n</Tabs>\\n\\n> View the official [Docker usage guide](../docs/guides/docker) for an in-depth walkthrough of all\\n> these new features!\\n\\n## Frontmatter for template files\\n\\nWe released [templates and the generator in v0.14](./v0.14) for quick and easy code generation.\\nSince it was the initial release, it provided the bare minimum of features for common workflows.\\nWe\'ll continually improve this system over each release, and have done just that for this release,\\nas all template files now support [frontmatter](../docs/guides/codegen#frontmatter)!

For some context, moon has\\nbeen designed to be language agnostic as we plan to support more than JavaScript in the future.\\nHowever, some aspects of the codebase were hard-coded for JavaScript and made the assumption that\\nJavaScript will always be used, with one such aspect being the\\n[`node`](../docs/config/workspace#node) setting in\\n[`.moon/workspace.yml`](../docs/config/workspace).\\n\\nWe\'ve reworked this setting to be optional, which allows a repository to opt out of JavaScript.\\nRight now, this basically does nothing as we do not support other languages yet, but we felt it\\nnecessary to report it anyways! A side-effect of this change is that actions in the runner have been\\nrenamed, for example, `SetupToolchain` -> `SetupNodeToolchain`.\\n\\n## Improved hashing accuracy\\n\\nOur [smart hashing layer](../docs/concepts/cache#hashing) is pretty powerful, but was not entirely\\naccurate. Up until now, when hashing a Node.js project, we\'d include the `dependencies`,\\n`devDependencies`, and `peerDependencies` versions located within the project\'s `package.json` as\\nhash inputs. This was great, because if a dependency was explicitly upgraded in the `package.json`,\\nit would invalidate the previous hashes as the version number changed.\\n\\nHowever, what if the dependency was implicitly upgraded by another project, but the `package.json`\\nwas not modified? These kind of transitive changes were currently ignored by moon, but no longer, as\\nmoon will now resolve all `package.json` dependencies to the resolved version found in the root\\nlockfile (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, etc)!\\n\\nAt moon, we believe in providing consumers with the ability to configure to their needs, and as\\nsuch, have added a new [`hasher`](../docs/config/workspace#hasher) setting to\\n[`.moon/workspace.yml`](../docs/config/workspace). This setting will allow you to choose between the\\n2 hashing patterns above!\\n\\n## New `moon check` command\\n\\nIf you\'re like us, you\'re constantly testing, linting, typechecking, so on and so forth, a project\\nwhile developing. This was rather cumbersome, as you either had to use separate run commands\\n(`moon run project:test`, `moon run project:lint`, etc), or use the multi-run approach\\n(`moon run project:test project:lint`). Both approaches were not ideal for rapid development.\\n\\nTo simplify this process, we\'ve added a new [`moon check`](../docs/commands/check) command, that\\nwill automatically run _all_ build and test tasks for a project (or many projects)! Local and non-CI\\ntasks will _not_ be ran.\\n\\n```shell\\n# Check project at current working directory\\n$ moon check\\n\\n# Check project by name\\n$ moon check app\\n\\n# Check multiple projects by name\\n$ moon check client server\\n```\\n\\n## New `@moonrepo/types` package\\n\\nWe have many ideas for moon specific npm packages that we plan to release, but before we do that, we\\nneed to ensure all of them are built with the correct interfaces. To solve this, we are shipping a\\nnew package, [@moonrepo/types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moonrepo/types), that simply publishes\\nTypeScript declarations. It contains everything from project and task shapes, configuration\\nstructures, runner information, and more.\\n\\n```ts\\nimport type { ProjectConfig } from \'@moonrepo/types\';\\n```\\n\\n## Other changes\\n\\nView the\\n[official release](https://github.com/moonrepo/moon/releases/tag/%40moonrepo%2Fcli%400.13.0) for a\\nfull list of changes.\\n\\n- The runner will now fail with an error if a task has defined `outputs` but an output was not\\n  created after the task is executed. This change was made so that artifacts are deterministic.\\n- The `actionRunner` setting in [`.moon/workspace.yml`](../docs/config/workspace) was renamed to\\n  `runner`.\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nExpect the following in the v0.14 release!\\n\\n- A `moon generate` command to generate new projects, files, scaffolding, and more from pre-defined\\n  templates.\\n- Implicit dependency discovery. moon will now scan manifest files and determine project\\n  relationships."}]}')}}]);
