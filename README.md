> Currently a work in progress!

moon is a repository *m*anagement, *o*rganization, *o*rchestration, and *n*otification tool for
JavaScript based projects, written in Rust. Many of the concepts within moon are heavily inspired
from Bazel and other popular build systems, but tailored for the JavaScript ecosystem.
